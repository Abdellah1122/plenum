-- Create a table for public profiles
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade not null primary key,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone,
  username text unique,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text,
  website text,

  constraint username_length check (char_length(username) >= 3)
);

-- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
-- See https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security for more details.
alter table profiles enable row level security;

create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." on profiles
  for select using (true);

create policy "Users can insert their own profile." on profiles
  for insert with check ((select auth.uid()) = id);

create policy "Users can update own profile." on profiles
  for update using ((select auth.uid()) = id);

-- This triggers a profile creation when a user signs up via Supabase Auth. 
-- Since we are using Clerk, we will need to handle this differently (e.g. via webhook or manual insert on login).
-- For now, this table stands ready.
